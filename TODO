In no particular order.

- Atom/RSS.
- Nicer diff:
  - Better stat section, with nicer handling of filenames. We should switch to
    --patch-with-raw and parse from that.
  - Nicer output, don't use pygments but do our own.
  - Anchors in diff sections so we can link to them.
- Short symlinks to commits, with configurable length.
- Handle symlinks properly.
- "X hours ago" via javascript (only if it's not too ugly).
